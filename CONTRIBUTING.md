# Contributing to tergite-autocalibration

**This project is currently not accepting pull requests from the general public yet.**

**It is currently being developed by the core developers only.**

## Government Model

[Chalmers Next Labs AB (CNL)](https://chalmersnextlabs.se) manages and maintains this project on behalf of all contributors.

## Version Control

Tergite is developed on a separate version control system and mirrored on Github.
If you are reading this on GitHub, then you are looking at a mirror. 

## Versioning

When versioning we follow the format `{year}.{month}.{patch_number}` e.g. `2023.12.0`.

## Contacting the Tergite Developers

Since the Github repositories are only mirrors, no Github pull requests or Github issue/bug reports 
are looked at. Please get in touch via email <quantum.nextlabs@chalmers.se> instead. 

Take note that the maintainers may not answer every email.

## But We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull
requests:

1. Clone the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software Licenses

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE.txt) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626).
Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Configuration

A number of configurations can be added to the tergite-autocalibration.
These include:

### - [`tergite_autocalibration/utils/user_input.py`](tergite_autocalibration/utils/user_input.py)

The sample-space for each node. 
The target node is also declared here.

### - [`tergite_autocalibration/config/device_config.toml`](tergite_autocalibration/config/device_config.toml)

A collection of reasonable initial values for the given device

### - [`dot-env-template.txt`](dot-env-template.txt)

Other parameters like the path to the Qblox Cluster configuration file (including IP address).

## Calibration Pipeline

Each calibration node goes through the following phases in order:

- compilation
- execution 
- post-processing
- redis updating

## Datasets

Datasets are stored in [`data_directory`](./data_directory)
They can be browsed with the dataset browser (coming soon)
