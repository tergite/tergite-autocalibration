# Tergite Automatic Calibration

![CI](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-autocalibration/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A commandline application to calibrate the WACQT quantum computers automatically.  

This project contains a calibration supervisor, a collection of calibration schedules and a collection of
post-processing and analysis routines.
It is developed and tested on WACQT Quantum Computer at Chalmers University of Technology.

**This project is developed by a core group of collaborators.**    
**Chalmers Next Labs AB (CNL) takes on the role of managing and maintaining this project.**

Note: The Tergite stack is developed on a separate version control system and mirrored on GitHub.

## Quick Start

### Dependencies

- Ensure you have [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) installed.
  (_You could simply have python +3.10 installed instead._)
- Ensure you have [redis server](https://redis.io/) running
- The standard port for a redis server is `6379`, so, this is going to be filled in the `.env` configuration later.

```shell
redis-server
```

### Installation

- Clone the repo
- If you are developing on another server e.g. the development server, please replace the url to clone

```shell
git clone git@github.com:tergite/tergite-autocalibration.git
```

- Create conda environment

```shell
conda create -n tac -y python=3.10 -y
conda activate tac
```

- Install the application

```shell
cd tergite-autocalibration
pip install -e .
```

- Copy the `.example.env` file to `.env` and 
  update the environment variables there appropriately.
- Check out the section about configuration about which other configuration files have to be edited.

```shell
cp .example.env .env
```

- Start the automatic calibration

```shell
acli calibration start
```

- For more help on other commands, type:

```shell
acli --help
```
