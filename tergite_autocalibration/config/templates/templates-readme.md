# How to use the /templates directory

Since we are producing, using and sharing a lot of configuration data, we share them in this directory.

There is one folder called `.default`, which has an empty example configuration package to see how it is structured.
Each of the other folders in here, are configuration packages, and describe a complete setup.
To learn more about how a configuration package looks like, please check out the docs.

In principle, it is possible to upload any data which relates to a setup.
Just if e.g. the configuration.meta.toml is missing, it would not be possible to load the configuration automatically.
