# Meta configuration
# In this file, we define which configurations are going to be used
# This file should be part of any configuration package

# The path_prefix defines the relative path from the meta configuration where configuration files are stored
path_prefix = 'configs'


# This section contains the relative paths plus the path_prefix to the configuration files
[files]

# ---
# Run-time related configurations
# ---
# run_config is all information related to the current run of the autocalibration
# This is e.g. the target node, qubits and couplers
run_config = 'run_config.toml'


# ---
# Instruments-related configuration
# ---
# cluster_config is what Q-BLOX needs to compile schedules on the hardware.
# It should be a file in json format, there is no default file
cluster_config = 'cluster_config.json'

# device_config contains the initial values for the device configuration.
device_config = 'device_config.toml'

# spi_config is the file to configure the wiring on the Q-BLOX Spi Rack.
# This is only necessary if you are running two-qubit calibrations.
# If you just want to run single-qubit calibrations, you can go without an SPI configuration.
spi_config = 'spi_config.toml'


# ---
# Calibration library related configuration
# ---
# NODE_CONFIG contains all values for the runtime of the program.
node_config = 'node_config.toml'

# USER_SAMPLESPACE gives the possibility to define custom samplespaces.
user_samplespace = 'user_samplespace.py'


[misc]

# ---
# Folders with additional files that belong to the calibration package
# ---
# Please add the folders as a relative path from the configuration.meta.toml
# Folders have to be on a lower level in the file system i.e. do not use paths like ../../my_files
#
# The key is the name of the additional files. For example:
# miscellaneous_files = "misc"
#
# The reason to have these files is to add unstructured data such as mixer corrections or wiring diagrams
# to the configuration package as additional information.

miscellaneous_files = "misc"
