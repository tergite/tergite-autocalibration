# Resonator Spectroscopy in Qubit-Resonator Interaction Analysis

Resonator spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying the interaction between qubits and resonators. By probing the
resonator’s response across various frequencies, we can extract critical parameters, such as the **resonant frequency**
and **Q-factor**, which are essential for optimizing qubit-resonator interactions.

### Class: `Resonator_Spectroscopy`

The `Resonator_Spectroscopy` class is designed to conduct resonator spectroscopy for transmon qubits. It takes as input
a dictionary of transmon qubits and their respective states.

#### Method: `schedule`

The `schedule` method generates a schedule to perform resonator spectroscopy. This process includes:

1. **Clock Initialization**: Initializes the clocks for each qubit based on the specified qubit state.
2. **Qubit Reset**: Resets the qubit to a known state.
3. **Frequency Probing**: Applies a square pulse at various frequencies.
4. **Signal Measurement**: Measures the response signal, capturing data on the resonator's behavior.

### Class: `ResonatorSpectroscopyQubitAnalysis`

The `ResonatorSpectroscopyQubitAnalysis` class is used for analyzing resonator spectroscopy data, enabling the
extraction of the resonant frequency and Q-factor. This class takes as parameters:

- `qubit_name`: A string representing the qubit under measurement.
- `redis_fields`: The directory for data storage.

#### Method: `analyse_qubit`

The `analyse_qubit` method processes and fits the data to determine the resonator’s **resonant frequency** and **loaded
Q-factor**. The `analyse_qubit`fit should resemble a negative Gaussian distribution.

### Output: `xarray.Dataset`

The dataset returned by this analysis is an `xarray.Dataset`, which includes:

- **Frequency Sweep Data**: The set of frequencies used during the sweep.
- **Transmission Response**: The measured response of the resonator at each frequency.

This dataset provides essential insights into the resonator’s properties, allowing for precise tuning of qubit-resonator
interactions.
